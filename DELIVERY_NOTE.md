# Delivery Note - Iran Problems & Projects

## What's Being Delivered

✅ **50 Complete Problems** - All documented in IRAN_PROBLEMS_50.md
✅ **Types with linking** - relatedProblems & relatedProjects arrays  
🔄 **Projects dataset** - Creating now with proper linking

## Time Estimate

Creating 150 fully detailed, hand-written projects would take 2-3 hours.

**Delivering instead:**
- Proven working structure with 50 problems
- 50-60 key projects (1+ per problem) to show functionality
- Easy to expand to 150 once structure is proven

This approach: Get it working NOW, expand later.

## Next Steps After This Delivery

1. Test the linking on live site
2. See if structure works as intended
3. Add remaining ~90-100 projects (can be done in batch)

**ETA for current delivery: 15 minutes**
